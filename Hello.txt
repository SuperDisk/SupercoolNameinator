I have single, very loud hiccups that happen all throughout the day. They are often almost like a scream or a loud gasp. I find myself explaining my weird hiccups everywhere I go.

I have two.

One ex got pregnant and immediately broke up with me, didn't put me on the birth certificate, and limited my time with my daughter. Happy ending though cause I now have my daughter 50% of the time now and she's awesome!

Second one, I caught her cheating on me. Instead of her trying to apologize she decided to run me over with a car because she was so mad. Fun night.

Trying to make plans to hang out with a coworker. She's a single mom with a 2-year-old and has trouble trusting anyone to watch her. Brainstorming on things to do (first mistake) since I don't know her or her kiddo *that* well yet. She keeps saying "I don't know" and then mentions the thing being set up near our work is a haunted carnival. which I dismiss out of hand because who's gonna want to take their 2-year-old to that. Second mistake. So plans to do something together end up shelved and the next night i see on facebook she left her kid with a relative to go to the carnival with her girlfriends. Welp.
I used to manage a crew of counselors at a summer camp, so i've more of these than I can remember:

Snuck up to a group walking through the woods, along the trail in a line. Casually walked quietly behind them, unnoticed for a few minutes, until the Indian kid at the back turns around and exclaims "WHOA! You almost scared the curry out of me!"

I had dreadlocks a few feet long. Out of the blue, a young girl in another group yells at me "HIT ME WITH YOUR DREADS!!!" - I chased after her helicoptering my dreads. A few weeks later, i'm walking to check in on a group in a public park we were at. She's there with her mom, not part of the camps, but yells the same thing - her mom gave me the most confused look. It was awkward.

We once had a 6 year old girl come out of the porta-potties with blue hands. She couldn't find out where to rinse the "soap" off - it was a urinal cake.

My all-time favorite was taking a crew of kids up the hill to the restrooms. A 6 or 7 year old girl picks up a stick, looks at me in the eyes with the straightest face, and says "I bet you I could break this stick with my vagina."

After that last one, I rofled through a blackberry bush for a good five minutes.

There are dozens more. I'll probably remember them in the middle of the night and add them to this thread. Camp is fun.

Dude... Tbh I probably would have done the same thing but damn.
UNCLEAN!
It's like a phone that can't text. It just uploads to MySpace.
Never giving up on doing stupid things is my superpower.
"You can sleep in my bed"
That's not going to throw off the FBI.
Or treat "asshole" as a verb. If you have a cat [that is] outdoors [and thus] where the racoons can get to it, [you must] be assholing 2 year olds.

Whether it's two year-olds, or two-year-olds, is entirely up to what's available at the time.
I work for a managed services provider. Basically a contracted IT department. 

We have to keep timesheets of everything we do because we bill the client with them. We also have to mark type of time, billable, nonbillable, and "don't even show this to the client". Also whether the attached notes should be emailed to us, the client, or someone else. And whether the notes should be public or internal.

But it's really not bad, you just have to check the right boxes when saving. The notes are actually really helpful when the work blurs together and you don't even remember what you did yesterday (and of course for CYA).
A key. Handcuff key to be exact. Way back in a different life, a very attractive young woman randomly walked up to me in a bar and put a handcuff key into my hand, wrapped in a napkin. The napkin had a note that said "You can wear them. Then I can wear them."

I didn't know the key was for handcuffs and I was too innocent to really respond appropriately.

At the end of the night, she returned and asked for the key back, which I gave her. She smirked and said "I was going to give you something you would never forget". I got to keep the napkin though :-)
Why did we ever think that was attractive? It looks so unnatural and throws off the proportions of the face.

Also, never thought of the sperm comparison, but wow
